; I before E except after C
; Background
; "I before E except after C" is perhaps the most famous English spelling rule. For the purpose of this ; challenge, the rule says:
; 
; if "ei" appears in a word, it must immediately follow "c".
; If "ie" appears in a word, it must not immediately follow "c".
; 
; A word also follows the rule if neither "ei" nor "ie" appears anywhere in the word. Examples of words that ; follow this rule are:
; ====================== 
; fiery hierarchy hieroglyphic
; ceiling inconceivable receipt
; daily programmer one two three
; ====================== 
;
; There are many exceptions that don't follow this rule, such as:
; ====================== 
; sleigh stein fahrenheit
; deifies either nuclei reimburse
; ancient juicier societies
; ====================== 
;
; Challenge
; Write a function that tells you whether or not a given word follows the "I before E except after C" rule.

; check("a") => true
; check("zombie") => true
; check("transceiver") => true
; check("veil") => false
